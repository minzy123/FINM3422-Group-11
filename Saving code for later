#TPG delivered underlying EBITDA of A$1,988 million, placing it at the midpoint of its FY24 guidance and in line with broader consensus estimates. Growth in mobile service revenue (+5% YoY) was the keycontributor, although this was offset by a decline in fixed-line performance. Average revenue per user (ARPU) in mobile increased by 4%, although subscriber numbers declined due to aggressive handset promotions by competitors such as Optus and Telstra and reduced international inbound migration. Looking ahead, the divestiture of Energy, Gas & Water (EG&W) assets weighed onreported top-line growth and earnings, inferring strengthened performance in FY25. 

#Cost containment featured prominently in TPG’s FY24 results. Group-level gross margins rose by 210bpsyear-on-year, although there was a slight sequential contraction of 50bps in H2—primarily due to theEG&W division. Operating expenses decelerated in H2, and management has guided for flat operating costs for FY25.
