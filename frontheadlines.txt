TPG Telecom reported FY24 underlying EBITDA of A$1,988 million, broadly aligned with both management’s
guidance and market consensus. This performance was underpinned by a solid 5% year-on-year increase 
in mobile service revenue, although this was partially offset by continued weakness in the Fixed
segment. Management’s emphasis on cost discipline contributed to a material improvement in free cash 
flow, a notable positive in the result. Earnings are expected to improve in the second half of FY25, 
driven by the ramp-up of the MOCN agreement and increased marketing, while capital
expenditure guidance has necessarily been lowered.

TPG delivered underlying EBITDA of A$1,988 million, placing it at the midpoint of its FY24 guidance 
and in line with broader consensus estimates. Growth in mobile service revenue (+5% YoY) was the key
contributor, although this was offset by a decline in fixed-line performance. 
Average revenue per user (ARPU) in mobile increased by 4%, although subscriber numbers declined due 
to aggressive handset promotions by competitors such as Optus and Telstra and reduced international 
inbound migration. Looking ahead, the divestiture of Energy, Gas & Water (EG&W) assets weighed on
reported top-line growth and earnings, inferring strengthened performance in FY25. 

Cost containment featured prominently in TPG’s FY24 results. Group-level gross margins rose by 210bps
year-on-year, although there was a slight sequential contraction of 50bps in H2—primarily due to the
EG&W division. Operating expenses decelerated in H2, and management has guided for flat operating 
costs for FY25.
