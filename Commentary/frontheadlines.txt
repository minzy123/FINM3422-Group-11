TPG Telecom reported FY24 underlying EBITDA of A$1,988 million, broadly aligned with both management’s guidance and market consensus. This performance was underpinned by a solid 5% year-on-year increase in mobile service revenue, although this was partially offset by continued weakness in the Fixedsegment. Management’s emphasis on cost discipline contributed to a material improvement in free cash flow, a notable positive in the result. Earnings are expected to improve in the second half of FY25, driven by the ramp-up of the MOCN agreement and increased marketing, while capitalexpenditure guidance has necessarily been lowered.
