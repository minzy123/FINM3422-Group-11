This could result in a more resilient balance sheet, improved credit metrics, and capacity for capital returns. Market sentiment may turn more favourable if management signals a potential dividend increase, share buybacks, or reinvestment into value-accretive growth initiatives (particularly as capex trends lower than historical norms).

Catalyst 3: Postpaid Subscriber Growth Reacceleration
TPG's mobile service revenue grew by 5% YoY in FY24, with ARPU increasing by 4%, but this was offset by a decline in overall subscriber numbers. Competitive dynamics, particularly aggressive promotions from Telstra and Optus, and a slowdown in international migration pressured net adds. However, management is increasing marketing activity in FY25 and stands to benefit from migration recovery and the MOCN rollout, which may boost its appeal in regional areas. A sustained improvement in postpaid subscriber growth would not only enhance revenue visibility but also improve margin profiles due to the higher lifetime value of postpaid customers. While subscriber numbers have softened amid competitive pressures and price adjustments, any sustained reversal in this trend (particularly in postpaid) would be a strong catalyst for sentiment improvement. A rebound in net migration, improved handset bundling strategies, and targeted customer incentives could all support a turnaround. If TPG demonstrates renewed momentum in net additions in upcoming quarters, especially with higher-margin postpaid customers, consensus forecasts could be revised upward.
