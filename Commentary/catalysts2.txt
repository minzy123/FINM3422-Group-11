Catalyst 2: Balance Sheet Strengthening Post-EG&W Divestiture

The strategic sale of TPG's Energy, Gas & Water (EG&W) division to Shell Energy in FY24 has enabled sharper operational focus on core telecom services while removing a low-margin, highly regulated business from the portfolio. Management reported stronger free cash flow performance post-divestiture, aided further by disciplined opex and revised FY25 capex guidance to lower levels. These developments are expected to improve the group's leverage profile (currently at net debt/EBITDA of 2.7x) and enhance its capacity to pursue value-creating initiatives or potentially return capital to shareholders. Following the EG&W asset divestiture, TPG's materially improved free cash flow profile and lower capital intensity present a clear path to deleveraging. This could result in a more resilient balance sheet, improved credit metrics, and capacity for capital returns. Market sentiment may turn more favourable if management signals a potential dividend increase, share buybacks, or reinvestment into value-accretive growth initiatives (particularly as capex trends lower than historical norms).

Catalyst 3: Postpaid Subscriber Growth Reacceleration

TPG's mobile service revenue grew by 5% YoY in FY24, with ARPU increasing by 4%, but this was offset by a decline in overall subscriber numbers. Competitive dynamics, particularly aggressive promotions from Telstra and Optus, and a slowdown in international migration pressured net adds. However, management is increasing marketing activity in FY25 and stands to benefit from migration recovery and the MOCN rollout, which will boost regional appeal. A sustained improvement in postpaid subscriber growth would not only enhance revenue visibility but also improve margin profiles due to the higher lifetime value of postpaid customers. While subscriber numbers have softened amid competitive pressures and price adjustments, any sustained reversal in this trend (particularly in postpaid) would be a strong catalyst for sentiment improvement. A rebound in net migration, improved handset bundling strategies, and targeted customer incentives could all support a turnaround. If TPG demonstrates renewed momentum in net additions in upcoming quarters, especially with higher-margin postpaid customers, consensus forecasts could be revised upward.
