The key downside risks for TPG include the potential for weaker than expected subscriber growth in both mobile and fixed line segments driven by heightened competition or a slower recovery in international arrivals and migration. Additionally if ARPU growth underperforms due to pricing pressures or limited uptake of premium services revenue and margin expectations may fall short. There is also a risk that increased investments particularly in network infrastructure and the MOCN partnership may not deliver the anticipated market share gains leading to lower returns on capital and dampened investor sentiment.
