Catalyst 1: Execution and Impact of the MOCN 2.0 Agreement with Optus

The Multi-Operator Core Network (MOCN) 2.0 agreement is an 11-year infrastructure-sharing deal between TPG and Optus, and received ACCC approval in September 2024. Under this arrangement, TPG will gain access to 2,444 Optus regional mobile sites, expanding its mobile coverage to 98.4% of the Australian population. In exchange, Optus will utilise certain TPG spectrum to enhance its network capacity. TPG will decommission most of its sites in the coverage area, transferring some to Optus, while both companies will maintain their own networks in metropolitan areas. Thia agreement is expected to enhance TPG's reach and service quality in regional markets, reduce long-term capital expenditure requirements, and support competitive positioning in areas where it previously had limited presence. Thus, the successful execution of the MOCN 2.0 agreement with Optus presents a pivotal catalyst in H2 FY25 and into FY26 that is not currently factored into the share price. As the rollout progresses, there will be improved regional coverage, user experience enhancements and market share gains. If these benefits materialise faster than expected, particularly through improved customer acquisition or churn reduction in underserved areas, this could lead to upward revisions in revenue forecasts and thus, the share price.
