Figure 4 illustrates the close price history of TPG Telecom compared to the ASX200 index over the past year. While TPGs share price exhibited some correlation with the broader market it displayed higher volatility particularly around late 2024 and early 2025. Notably TPGs price resilience in March 2025 contrasts with the significant decline observed in the ASX200 suggesting stock specific factors supporting TPGs valuation despite broader market weakness. Overall TPG has maintained a relatively stable trading range between $4.00 and $5.00 demonstrating moderate defensiveness compared to the broader index.
