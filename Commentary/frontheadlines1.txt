Mobile Growth Steady Amid Competitive Headwinds: Underlying EBITDA of A$1,988 million places it at the midpoint of its FY24 guidance and in line with broader consensus estimates. Growth in mobile service revenue (+5% YoY) was the key contributor, although this was offset by a decline in fixed-line performance. Average revenue per user (ARPU) in mobile increased by 4%, although subscriber numbers declined due to aggressive handset promotions by competitors such as Optus and Telstra and reduced international inbound migration. Looking ahead, the divestiture of Energy, Gas & Water (EG&W) assets weighed onreported top-line growth and earnings, inferring strengthened performance in FY25.
