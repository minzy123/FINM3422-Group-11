The wireless communicator industry is heavily characterised by its concentrated competitive landscape, 
placing pressure on margins and profitability. However, TPG's strategic divestiture over FY24 has
ensured it is performing well operationally. While there are some risks surrounding the balance sheet health, 
the divestiture of the EGW assets should generate improved cash flow generation and reduce capex intensity,
with management confident. Additionally, the proposed MOCN 2.0 agreement with Optus could not only 
materially change the company's product quality, the expanded reach will drive market-share gains in
a very concentrated industry. However, it is important to note that postpaid subscriber growth has
been relatiely stagnant due to TPG's new prices this year, with the stock trading close to the 
proposed price target. This, coupled with the competitive outlook led to a hold.
