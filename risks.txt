Based on our hold position of TPG, there are a number of upside and downside risks to consider. 


1. Increased Mobile and Fixed Subscribers

A key source of potential upside lies in higher-than forecast growth in both mobile and fixed-line subscribers. Accelerated customer acquisition, peraticularly through TPG's increased marketing initiative coupled with its MOCN expansion could drive top-line performance. Additionally, a rebound in net migration and international arrivals may also bolster mobile prepaid and postpaid growth. ARPU expansion exceeding expectations. 

2. Increased APRU  

If ARPU increases at a faster pace than anticipated, through effective pricing strategies, bundling or upselling of value-added services revenue and margin outcomes could materially exceed forecasts. This is particularly relevant in this competitive environment, where operators are exercising greater pricing discipline. 

3. Investment-led market share gains

Given TPG's recent history with divestiture and partnerships, increased or more efficiently deployed investment in network infrastructure, digital platforms or customer service could yield outsized returns through enhanced customer acquisition and retention.
