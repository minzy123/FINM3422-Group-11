Figure 4 illustrates the close price history of TPG Telecom compared to the ASX200 Index over the past year. While TPG's share price showed some correlation with the broader market, it exhibited higher volatility, especially around late 2024 and early 2025. Notably, TPG's price resilience in March 2025 contrasts with the significant decline seen in the ASX200, suggesting stock-specific factors supporting TPG's valuation despite broader market weakness. Overall, TPG has maintained a relatively stable trading range between $4.00 and $5.00, showing moderate defensiveness relative to the broader index.

Further, the graph shows the historical price targets for TPG over the past year. Analyst expectations have gradually trended lower over time, with a brief spike in late 2024. Since then, price targets have declined steadily, reaching their lowest levels in early 2025. The consistent downward revision highlights weakening market sentiment toward TPG and reflects reduced confidence in near-term earnings growth.
